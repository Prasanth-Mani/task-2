Difference betweeen Window and Document Objects:
           What is the Window Object ?
                         The window object represents the browser's window or tab.
                         It is the global context in which JavaScript runs and provides 
                         essential properties and methods for managing the browser environment.
            What is the Document Object?
                        The document object is a property of the window object that represents
                        the web page loaded in the browser. It provides an interface to interact 
                        with and manipulate the contents of the HTML document.        


Key Differences
Scope :

Window => Represents the browser window or tab and provides a global scope for JavaScript.
Document => Represents the HTML document loaded within the window, focusing on the content and structure of the web page. 


Conclusion :
      In summary, while the window and document objects are both integral parts of JavaScript's interaction with web browsers,
      they serve different roles. The window object is your gateway to the browser environment, while the document object gives
      you the tools to manipulate the web page itself. Understanding these distinctions will help you write more effective and 
      organized JavaScript code, ultimately enhancing your web development skills.
